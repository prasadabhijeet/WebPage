            <p> Salvador and I met in the Philippines in 2011. I just got back from studying in Italy so I tried to travel around the Philippines. At the time, he was also studying and living in Taiwan. Together with Fernando, his Mexican roommate in Taipei, they frequented the Philippines on school breaks. Fernando and I were closer. When I met him in El Nido, Salvador was just arriving from Taipei so we bonded a bit later. Fernando is a super intelligent human being and I will always remember him as one of the smartest people I’ve encountered while traveling. He always made sense. His arguments are intellectual. When he says something, I learn something new.</p>

            <p>The conversation continued. I know he already said he’s in the Philippines (again) but I’d like to take my chance in staying for free. I remember Salvador told me he’s staying with his family (including his grandmother) so I hoped I can learn some Peruvian cooking with grandma. It’s just a few days.

He didn’t reply so I typed again.

“I am sorry for asking last minute but I planned my Peru travels rather poorly but if I can’t stay with you, I’ll find another Couchsurfing in Lima.”

When we met in the Philippines, Salvador repeatedly offered his home to me in case I go to Peru. I mentally noted that although I never imagined I will be traveling to Peru real soon. Not even in my wildest dreams. It just happened to me. I’m sure we’ve all done that when-you-go-to-my-country-I-will-take-care-of-you kind of promises because we never really know when these people are going to come. Offers like this and it stays on the table until we forget about it. Or until they eventually come for real.</p>

            <p>My friends and family back home always asked me why I would randomly go to people I don’t know. I return to those moments when I stayed with a Colombian family in Barranquilla for three months, when I worked in a family hostel in Quito, when I did Couchsurfing with an Irish expat in Panama. I was received in more than 100 homes through the years I was traveling Latin America. I shared their food, I spoke their language, I listened to their music, I worshipped their Gods – these people have demonstrated to me the existence of immense goodness of humanity. That is something I am proud to have achieved in this lifetime.

I had to say goodbye to Facundo that day as I needed to go to Paracas for another volunteering gig. I never had a chance to see him again despite my frequent visits in Lima but I will always cherish that night I shared with Facundo. No matter how brief, I will never omit every single person who accepted me in their homes whilst traveling South America.</p>
